## Data:
We are working with a few different data sets, all from the website Kaggle. Kaggle is a informatics website where people can upload data and different scripts. 

This is data on COVID-19 vaccination progress taken from Kaggle. The data was, during the period, updated daily. 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress?select=country_vaccinations.csv&fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR3OtW8D_QG9A8kUlkJYTV6N-zb-8QOyffgzf9W7KmfZcp-Hxfhpa-WOCBQ_aem_GT1aKjRx2iNuKZoEzxbADw

There are two csv. files within this dataset: 

country_vaccinations.csv (17.73 MB)

country_vaccinations_by_manufacturer.csv(1.5 MB)

We also use this data on the world population by coutry/territory, where the population of each country is listed from 1970 to 2022. Other information can also be found.

world_population.csv (29.25 KB)

Our thought with data sets has been to look at how different nations handled the Covid-19 pandemic. We want to look at which vaccines where used and how fast the world has to adapt to the circumstances. 

Things that we know:
