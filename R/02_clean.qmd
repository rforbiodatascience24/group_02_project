## Clean data 1

```{r}
#|echo: false

# Loading libraries 
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

We load the dataset

```{r}
#|echo: false

# Importing load data
manufacturer_update <- read_tsv("../data/01_manufacturer_load.tsv")
vaccines_update <- read_tsv("../data/01_vaccines_load.tsv")
world_population_update <- read_tsv("../data/01_world_population_load.tsv")
```

We inspect the structure

```{r}
# Looking at the data 
glimpse(manufacturer_update)
glimpse(vaccines_update)
glimpse(world_population_update)
```

We start of by cleaning manufacturer data

```{r}
# Cleaning manufacturer data 
manufacturer_cleaned <- manufacturer_update |>
  distinct() |> #This is to remove any duplicates there might be
  drop_na(location, date, vaccine) |> #removing the missing
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")) #Here we make sure the dates are in the corret format

```

We do the same with the vaccine data

```{r}
# Cleaning vaccine data 
vaccines_cleaned <- vaccines_update |> 
  distinct() |> 
  mutate(
    date = as.Date(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d"),
    total_vaccinations = if_else(is.na(total_vaccinations), NA_real_, total_vaccinations),
    daily_vaccinations = if_else(is.na(daily_vaccinations), NA_real_, daily_vaccinations),
    vaccines = replace_na(vaccines, "unknown") #Replace rows where the vaccines are missing with unknown, so it doesn't get grouped with the numeric NA
  ) |>
  
  
  
  mutate(
    missing_total_vaccinations = is.na(total_vaccinations), #Using this we can flag the missing rows
    missing_daily_vaccinations = is.na(daily_vaccinations)
  )
```

Since the world population data is already tidy, and we only want to left join it to our other data to make a more comprehensive data set, we have decided to remove some irrelevant columns and then proceed.

```{r}
# Cleaning world population data 
world_population_cleaned <- world_population_update |> 
  select(`Country/Territory`, # Selecting the only relevant columns form the data
         `Continent`,
         `2022 Population`,
         `2020 Population`,
         `Growth Rate`)
```

Now we write the files:

```{r}
# Writing 02_cleaned files
## Manufacturer cleaned
write.csv(x = manufacturer_cleaned,
          file = str_c("../data/", "02_manufacturer_cleaned.tsv"))

## Vaccnies cleaned
write.csv(x = vaccines_cleaned,
          file = str_c("../data/", "02_vaccines_cleaned.tsv"))

## World population cleaned
write.csv(x = world_population_cleaned,
          file = str_c("../data/", "02_world_population_cleaned.tsv"))
```
