### Loading data

Here we will make a new data file under the data-folder named; "01\_...\_load.tsv". We will combine the two data sets that we have into one.

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(tidyverse)

# Load data into variable
vaccines <- "../data/_raw/country_vaccinations.csv"
manufacturer <- "../data/_raw/country_vaccinations_by_manufacturer.csv"

# Read CSV 
vaccines_data <- read_csv(vaccines)
manufacturer_data <- read_csv(manufacturer)

# Writing TSV files
## Vaccines data
write_tsv(x = vaccines_data,
          file = str_c("../data/", "01_vaccines_load.tsv"))
## Manufacturer data 
write_tsv(x = manufacturer_data,
          file = str_c("../data/", "01_manufacturer_load.tsv"))
```
